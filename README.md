# PositiveEV & Arbitrage Bot

Welcome to the PositiveEV & Arbitrage Bot! This tool is designed to help you take advantage of arbitrage opportunities and positive EV (Expected Value) plays across various sportsbooks. 

## Features

- **Real-Time Queries:** The bot queries 20+ sportsbooks every 5 seconds to find arbitrage and positive EV plays.
- **Notifications:** Receive SMS notifications with links to the plays for quick access.
- **Automated Betting:** For PrizePicks, the bot will automatically place bets for positive EV plays, even while youâ€™re sleeping.

## API Endpoints

To access the public endpoints, you will need an API key. Please email [jamisen.ma@gmail.com](mailto:jamisen.ma@gmail.com) to request access or to obtain an API key.

## How It Differs From Competitors

- **Speed and Efficiency:** Placing live arbitrage bets manually is challenging due to the rapid changes in sportsbook lines. Even with tools like OddsJam or OddsView, the time it takes to find and place bets can result in missed opportunities. Our bot automates this process, ensuring you can place bets quickly before the lines change.
- **Automated Positive EV Plays:** Manual positive EV betting can be problematic, especially with PrizePicks, where lines are adjusted instantly when a certain number of people place the same bet. Our bot places bets within a second after identifying positive EV plays, preventing the issue of adjusted lines.
